## ⚡️ Overview

**Payment Infrastructure as Code**
Manage your payment stack using code — with **native support for Stripe**, and the easiest path to **pragmatically migrate to an x402-based stack**, helping you **break free from 3% commissions**.

## 🚀 Why MoneyMQ?

Most teams manage payments through dashboards, scripts, and ad-hoc automations.
That’s fine — until you:
- change a price and forget to update test mode,
- break an integration during a migration,
- or want to add another provider to reduce fees.

MoneyMQ brings **Infrastructure-as-Code** principles to payments:
- ✅ Version control your catalog and flows in Git
- 🔍 Diff and review every change before applying
- 💾 Work locally, sync safely to providers
- 🔁 Deploy to multiple rails (Stripe, x402, custom)
- ⚙️ Type-safe, portable, and open source

Start with **Stripe**, the ecosystem you already know.
When you’re ready, **extend or migrate** to **x402**, an open payment rail optimized for programmable money and dramatically lower fees.
